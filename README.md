Colorado’s 2-year-old “red flag” law gives police officers and average citizens alike the power to seek the removal of guns from people they believe are dangerous – but a 9Wants to Know investigation found the chances that will actually happen depend largely on who’s asking.

Of the 244 unique red flag petitions that were filed, 146 were granted. That’s an approval rate of 60% – significantly lower than predictions before the law took effect that 95% of the petitions would be granted.

Of the 107 petitions filed by law enforcement officers, 101 – or 95% – were granted. But of the rest, which were filed by citizens, about 32% were approved.

NOTE: 9NEWS is not naming those who applied for red flag applications or those who had an order against them because they are not accused of a crime. So the code is available but not the raw data. 9NEWS went through every case to add names and dates of births to the data.
